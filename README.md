# Analyzing Customer Data from an Online Clothing Retailer

The aim of this project is to become familiar solving business problems using linear regression in a Python environment. 

Scenario: 
You just got some contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The company is trying to decide whether to **focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.**   

**RESULTS**

There is a strong linear realtionship between the amount of money a customer spends in a year and the length of that customers membership. Also, between the two platforms (moblie app and website) there is a stronger relationship between time spent on the moblie app and yearly amount spent.

Therefore, the company should first focus on customer retention, and then focus on keeping people on the app longer. The low correlation between website and yearly spending could be due to a poor website, and therefore if the website can be easily improved, the company might find a better return on investment with that approach.
